CHAPTER 2. MARKOV ALGORITHM

2.1 Machine specific window
    This part of the main window contains the only line that represents memory
    of machine. You can change memory content and changes are applied
    immediately. Note, while execution in continuous mode memory is locked and
    you can't change it.

2.2 Description
    Code of Markov algorithm is set of rules that look like "str1->str2" where
    string before operator -> is replaced with one that follows the operator.
    Every time the first rule that can be applied is chosen for execution. The
    last operation is marked with "->.". This means if rule with a dot that
    follows operator -> is executed machine is stopped and execution is
    completed.
